# C++ Practice Programs

This repository contains all my C++ practice files, organized by chapters and problem topics.  
The goal of this repo is to track my learning, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain a clean record of my coding journey.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

The files are organized by chapters (chapter1, chapter2, … chapter9).  
Each folder includes multiple C++ programs from basic to intermediate level:

- **Basic syntax and operators**
- **Loops and conditional statements**
- **Functions and recursion**
- **Arrays and strings**
- **Pointers**
- **STL basics**
- **OOP concepts**
- **String manipulation**
- **Practice problems**

## 🚀 What This Repository Includes

✔ Beginner-friendly C++ programs  
✔ Clean folder structure  
✔ File-per-problem format  
✔ Logical problem breakdowns  
✔ Continuous progress tracking

## 🛠️ How to Run These Programs

1. Open terminal in macOS/Linux (or CMD/PowerShell in Windows).
2. Use the g++ compiler to compile a file:

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

For example:

g++ reverseString.cpp -o reverse
./reverse

## ⭐ Goals of This Repository

- Strengthen C++ fundamentals  
- Build consistency through daily coding  
- Prepare for DSA, coding interviews, and competitive programming  
- Maintain a record of all solved problems

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add comments to all programs  
- Add problem descriptions  
- Add DSA-based solutions  
- Convert some problems into class-based OOP solutions  
- Add unit test cases (optional)
